      <p>My name is Amanda (Mandy) Joles. I currently work for a law firm, Crane and Norcross, that appeals property taxes located in the heart of the loop. I am an administrative assistant and secretary to the owner, Michael Crane.</p>
      <p>I currently am enrolled in Nortwestern's Coding Boot Camp and I love it so far. Who would  have thought on day 4 I would be creating my very own webpage! I enrolled in Boot Camp because I am looking for a career shift, something that will challenge my mind and grab my attention. I feel as if I am not challenged at my current job.</p>
