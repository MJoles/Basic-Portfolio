              My name is Amanda (Mandy) Joles. I currently work for a law firm, Crane and Norcross, that appeals property taxes located in the heart of the loop. I am an administrative assistant and secretary to the owner, Michael Crane.

              I currently am enrolled in Nortwestern's Coding Boot Camp and I love it so far. Who would  have thought on day 4 I would be creating my very own webpage! I enrolled in Boot Camp because I am looking for a career shift, something that will challenge my mind and grab my attention. I feel as if I am not challenged at my current job.

              I have a dog named Sasha and a cat named Gizmo. They are my world! In my spare time I enjoy gardening, reading, riding my bike, and going on walks with Sasha. I also enjoy excercising whenever I have the time. I usually try to fit this in during my lunch hour at work since there is a gym in my office building.
